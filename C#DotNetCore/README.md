## Kata in C# DotNetCore

## Boot Introduction

Taken from the Gitlab C# DotNetCore template.
This is a simple pipeline example for a .NET Core application, showing just
how easy it is to get up and running with .NET development using GitLab.

If you're new to .NET you'll want to check out the tutorial, but if you're
already a seasoned developer considering building your own .NET app with GitLab,
this should all look very familiar.

## What's contained in this project

The root of the repository contains 2 librairies, one standard lib designed to be under tests (hence his name)
antoher one dedicated to be launched as a test lib with XUnit.

In addition to the .NET Core content, there is a ready-to-go `.gitignore` file
sourced from the the .NET Core [.gitignore](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/.gitignore). This
will help keep your repository clean of build files and other configuration.

Finally, the `.gitlab-ci.yml` contains the configuration needed for GitLab
to build your code. Let's take a look, section by section.

First, we note that we want to use the official Microsoft .NET SDK image
to build our project.

```
image: microsoft/dotnet:latest
```

We're defining two stages here: `build`, and `test`. As your project grows
in complexity you can add more of these.

```
stages:
    - build
    - test
```

Next, we define our build job which simply runs the `dotnet build` command and
identifies the `bin` folder as the output directory. Anything in the `bin` folder
will be automatically handed off to future stages, and is also downloadable through
the web UI.

```
build:
    stage: build
    script:
        - "dotnet build"
    artifacts:
      paths:
        - bin/
```

Similar to the build step, we get our test output simply by running `dotnet test`.

```
test:
    stage: test
    script: 
        - "dotnet test"
```

This should be enough to get you started. There are many, many powerful options 
for your `.gitlab-ci.yml`. You can read about them in our documentation 
[here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/yaml/).
